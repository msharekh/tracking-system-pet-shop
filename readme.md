## Background

`Pete Scandlon` of Pete's Pet Shop is interested in using Ethereum as an efficient way to handle their pet adoptions. 
The store has space for `16 pets` at a given time, and they already have a database of pets. 
As an initial proof of concept, Pete wants to see a dapp which associates an Ethereum address with a pet to be adopted.
